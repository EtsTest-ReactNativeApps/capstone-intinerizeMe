_This dynamic site is intended for the traveler who can never decide what to do with their day. It allows the user to enter in their travel dates and location and be able to get a curated day by day trip plan using the Triposo API. They are able to login and add different trips to their list and save them to the database. They will be able to see each location on a Google map to know exactly where they are going each day._
